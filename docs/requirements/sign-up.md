  "password": "String123"
}
```

- Required fields: `name`, `email`, `password`

- Email must be in valid format.
  1. **Local part** (before `@`): 1â€“35 **latin** characters, special characters allowed (```! # $ % & ' * + - / = ? ^ _ ` { | } ~ ```), must not start or end with a dot (`.`), cannot have repeated dots (`..`)
